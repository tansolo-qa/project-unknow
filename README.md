# Full Stack QA Portfolio 🚀

Welcome to my comprehensive **QA Automation & Full Stack Development Portfolio**. This project is a monorepo that showcases expertise across the entire testing pyramid and development lifecycle.

## 🌟 Portfolio Website
The landing page you see here is built with **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. It serves as a centralized hub to demonstrate my technical arsenal and featured projects.

## 🏗️ Core Projects

This repository contains four specialized projects, each targeting a critical area of Quality Engineering:

### 1. [E2E Automation Framework](file:///e:/POC/project-unknow/projects/e2e-automation)
*   **Goal**: Enterprise-grade E2E testing.
*   **Stack**: Playwright, TypeScript, Allure Reports.
*   **Key Features**: Page Object Model (POM), Data-Driven Testing, CI/CD Integration via GitHub Actions.

### 2. [API & Contract Testing](file:///e:/POC/project-unknow/projects/api-contract-testing)
*   **Goal**: Robust backend and middleware verification.
*   **Stack**: Jest, Supertest, Pact.io.
*   **Key Features**: Consumer-Driven Contract Testing, Security/Auth validation, Dockerized test environments.

### 3. [Performance & Load Testing](file:///e:/POC/project-unknow/projects/performance-load-testing)
*   **Goal**: Performance bench-marking and bottleneck analysis.
*   **Stack**: k6, InfluxDB, Grafana.
*   **Key Features**: 1k+ VU simulation, real-time monitoring dashboard, Docker Compose setup.

### 4. [Test Data Manager (Full Stack App)](file:///e:/POC/project-unknow/projects/test-data-manager)
*   **Goal**: Solving data dependency issues with custom tooling.
*   **Stack**: Next.js (Full Stack), MongoDB, Tailwind.
*   **Key Features**: CRUD interface for test data, RESTful API, modern responsive dashboard.

## 🚀 Technical Highlights (Phase 2)
Recently enhanced across the portfolio:
*   **Multi-User Contexts (Project A)**: Implemented Playwright `browser.newContext()` to simulate concurrent users and verify session isolation (e.g., Cart Isolation).
*   **Schema Validation (Project B)**: Integrated `jest-json-schema` to enforce strict API contract structure beyond simple status codes.
*   **Strict SLAs (Project C)**: Tuned performance thresholds to specific latencies (p95 < 300ms) and zero tolerance for errors used in high-scale envs.
*   **Bulk Data Gen (Project D)**: Added `Faker.js` integration to generate thousands of realistic user records instantly via API & UI.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### 1. Run the Portfolio Website
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

### 2. Run Portfolio Self-Tests (E2E)
We use a **"Testing the Tester"** approach—verified via root-level Playwright tests.
```bash
# Install Playwright browsers (first time only)
npx playwright install --with-deps

# Run E2E tests
npm run test:e2e
```
